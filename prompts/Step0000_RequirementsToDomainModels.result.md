**Domain Model**

1. Bounded Contexts:
   - ProductManagement | OrderManagement | CustomerManagement | ResearchInformation | ReportGeneration | SecurityAndAuthentication | RewardCalculation

2. Entities:
   - ProductManagement: InvestmentTrust, TrustPrice, TrustFee
   - OrderManagement: Order, OrderStatus, OrderHistory
   - CustomerManagement: UserAccount, InvestmentGoal, RiskTolerance, Portfolio, Notification
   - ResearchInformation: ResearchReport, InvestmentAdvice
   - ReportGeneration: TrustEvaluation, ProfitRate, PeriodicReport, LegalReport
   - SecurityAndAuthentication: AccessControl, StaffAccount, AgencyAccount, AuthenticationMethod
   - RewardCalculation: Reward, Fee, PaymentHistory

3. Value Objects:
   - ProductManagement: TrustDetails, PerformanceHistory, ExpenseRatio
   - OrderManagement: PurchaseOrder, SellOrder
   - CustomerManagement: UserInformation, InvestmentProfile
   - ResearchInformation: TrustInformation
   - ReportGeneration: ReportContent
   - SecurityAndAuthentication: Credentials
   - RewardCalculation: RewardAmount, FeeAmount

4. Aggregates:
   - ProductManagement: InvestmentTrustAggregate(InvestmentTrust, TrustPrice, TrustFee, TrustDetails, PerformanceHistory, ExpenseRatio)
   - OrderManagement: OrderAggregate(Order, OrderStatus, OrderHistory, PurchaseOrder, SellOrder)
   - CustomerManagement: UserAccountAggregate(UserAccount, UserInformation, InvestmentGoal, RiskTolerance, Portfolio, Notification, InvestmentProfile)
   - ResearchInformation: ResearchReportAggregate(ResearchReport, InvestmentAdvice, TrustInformation)
   - ReportGeneration: ReportAggregate(TrustEvaluation, ProfitRate, PeriodicReport, LegalReport, ReportContent)
   - SecurityAndAuthentication: AuthenticationAggregate(AccessControl, StaffAccount, AgencyAccount, AuthenticationMethod, Credentials)
   - RewardCalculation: RewardCalculationAggregate(Reward, Fee, PaymentHistory, RewardAmount, FeeAmount)

5. Repositories:
   - InvestmentTrustRepository
   - OrderRepository
   - UserAccountRepository
   - ResearchReportRepository
   - ReportRepository
   - AuthenticationRepository
   - RewardCalculationRepository

6. Services:
   - ProductManagementService
   - OrderManagementService
   - CustomerManagementService
   - ResearchInformationService
   - ReportGenerationService
   - SecurityAndAuthenticationService
   - RewardCalculationService

7. Factories:
   - InvestmentTrustFactory
   - OrderFactory
   - UserAccountFactory
   - ResearchReportFactory
   - ReportFactory
   - AuthenticationFactory
   - RewardCalculationFactory

8. Context Mapping:
   - ProductManagement <-> OrderManagement
   - OrderManagement <-> CustomerManagement
   - CustomerManagement <-> ResearchInformation
   - ResearchInformation <-> ReportGeneration
   - ReportGeneration <-> SecurityAndAuthentication
   - SecurityAndAuthentication <-> RewardCalculation

9. Business Rules and Constraints:
   - InvestmentTrust must have a unique identifier
   - Order must have a valid InvestmentTrust and UserAccount
   - UserAccount must have a unique identifier and valid credentials
   - ResearchReport must be associated with an InvestmentTrust
   - ReportGeneration must comply with legal requirements
   - AuthenticationMethod must provide a secure way to authenticate users
   - Reward and Fee calculations must follow the agreed-upon rules

10. Refactoring:
   - As the system evolves, the domain model should be continuously refactored to better represent the problem domain and improve the design.
